            <p>I was born and raised in Glendale, Arizona where I lived until I was 14. Growing up I had a close group of friends and I participated in a lot of competitive sports. My main sport was swimming, which I did for roughly ten years. I also played other sports when I was younger such as football, soccer, and karate. When I moved to the Bay Area it was a very big transition for me being as young as I was, but in the end I believe that it was for the better. Living here I continued to swim and began playing waterpolo.</p>
